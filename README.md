Hello folks, i am Mr Edgeworth. I programme in mostly python/html, but can put my hand to other languages(mostly c++ and lua) if needed. 
I'm self taught, so i prefer functionality and cleanliness of code rather than clarity.
Whatever the current project is, i allow people to use it as long as its for private use, or code optimisation etc. 
Currently studying networks/cyber securities as of 09/19.
My activity on github is all over the place, so please be patient with me.
Programming is a hobby, so any questions about my project code are welcome :) (as long as they are not deragatory :P)



Cheers,
Nate/Nathan (Mr Edgeworth)
