Hello folks, i am Mr Edgeworth. I programme in mostly python/html, but can put my hand to other languages(mostly c++ and lua) if needed. I'm self taught, so i prefer functionality and cleanliness of code rather than clarity.
Whatever the current project is, i allow people to use it as long as its for private use, or code optimisation etc. 
Dont look to me to keep my code clean.
Currently studying networks/cyber securities as of 09/19.
Programming is a hobby, so any questions about my project code are welcome :)



Cheers,
Nate/Nathan (Mr Edgeworth)
